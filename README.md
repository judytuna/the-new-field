The New Field
=============

A collaborative story attempt. 

Members:  

 * Richard Littauer
 * Simon Vansintjan
 * Roberto Burgos
 
Our commits tell stories; the links we follow trace trails in the web. We are makers, and we are movers, and we are doers. We work best when we help each other. Why shouldn't we then tell stories with each other?

Some groundrules:

 * All groundrules have to be agreed upon by everyone.
 * All rules previously established stand for new members until they are taken down by all of the members.
 * You can change anything. Use humility to know when this doesn't apply. 
 * If you have an idea, work it in. 
 * No using the wiki or pages or private notes. Bring it all to the table, here. 
 * Work collaboratively, share, talk, invite, spread, disseminate, take ownership.
 * We are bound by nothing written down, but only by what we can build up. 
 * Have fun!
 
Let's see what we do.
