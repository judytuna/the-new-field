  		A new field lay beneath my window

      <p>It was green and wide, and dotted with tiny white flowers. The sky was mostly clear, though I could see clouds in the distance.</p>
      <p>A banana slug rushed through the field looking back over its shoulder every ten seconds as if running away from trouble. It's name was Orpheus.</p>
