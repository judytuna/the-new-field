      <p>My pet Falcon is always getting into trouble. All the neighbors know him. Most days you can find him chewing Judy's BITCOINS. But I don't know what got into him yesterday. I had just taken him out for his morning walk when a LIGER leaped out from behind a tree. My pet jumped ten feet into the air! He started to MEOW really loudly. He took off SOARING at about a million miles an hour. Luckily he had stepped in CLOUDS and left a trail of WHITE DRUMSTICK prints all the way to the nearest store. By the time I got there, three employees were chasing my pet out of the store. The animal was running down the street with a brand-new pair of VANS on his TALONS. The next thing I knew, he dashed into a restaurant, jumped onto a couch, snatched an APPLE of a customer's plate, and ran out the backdoor. I thought I had lost him completely when I walked by another store. There he was, curled up asleep next to MICE in a window. As LAZILY as I could, I clipped on his leash and walked him straight home. Boy was he in the doghouse!</p>

  		A new field lay beneath my window
  		</h1>
      <p>It was green and wide, and dotted with tiny white flowers. The sky was mostly clear, though I could see clouds in the distance.</p>
      <p>To the east lay the Grand Mountains, a range of peaks stretching north hundreds of miles from the shores of the Camreon Ocean until they slowly gave way to the endless verdant fields of the Plains of Armok.</p>
